        <p>My favorite meal is Jollof Rice (Nigerian). It is a rice dish from West Africa. The origins of jollof rice
             can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th 
             century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. The 
             dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish 
             and vegetables. Each West African country has at least one variant form of the dish, with Ghana, 
             Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Cameroon particularly competitive as to which country makes the
              best jollof. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana, in a rivalry dubbed
               the "Jollof Wars". Jollof rice is highly nutritious in carbohydrates</p>

            <li>Prepare the tomato stew by frying some onions along with fresh tomatoes and sachet tomato.</li>
            <li>Wash the chicken. Cook with the thyme, salt and pepper to taste, seasoning cubes and 2 bulbs of
                 onions (chopped).  When done, grill it in an oven or fry. This is to give it a golden look 
                 which is more presentable.</li>
            <li>Parboil the rice, and when boiled rinse the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain and 
                ready for use.</li>
            <li>Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot and leave to boil.</li> 
            <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, spices of your choice if you wish, then salt and 
                pepper to taste. The water level should be the same level of the rice. This is to ensure that 
                all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked.</li>  
            <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before 
                the water dries up.</li>    
            <li>Taste to confirm If you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning. 
                Keep cooking till done. </li>     
            <li>Serve with Peppered Fish, Fried Plantains, Nigerian Moi Moi, Nigerian Salad or Coleslaw.</li>
